## Git Workflow

As this is my personal project, I'm doing a lot of the initial work with small local branches and command line merges. Things like documentation **are** sometimes committed straight to main but **are not** any sort of code change. Even a config change needs to be merged in after testing.

It's just that I'll be doing some of this development offline so I have a local workflow that will be harder to inspect the usual GitHub way. To that end, let me know if I'm squashing out valuable information -- I won't be cleaning up my local branches or reusing them very often so rebuilding history should be possible? At least based on my growing understanding of git.
